							<h2><strong>What Can Work Scheduler Do For <i>You</i>?</strong></h2>
						</header>
						<div class="row aln-center">
							<p>When it comes to working at places like a supermarket, retail store, and many more, 
							scheduling can quickly become an annoying and unnecessary problem for many working adults.
							If you have been assigned a shift that you would not be able to make, you have to deal with the inconvenience of asking
							other employees if they can cover for your shift, or you may have to talk to the managers to see if they can schedule you
							for a different time.  Luckily, <i>Work Scheduler</i> seeks to avoid those unnecessary issues! <br><br>
							This scheduling application allows people to plan their schedules ahead of time with ease in an attempt to combat
							issues of figuring out availability and overall time management.  Once you have created a schedule of your liking,
							you may save it and have the schedulers at your work review it and approve of it.  Using this application relieves 
							you of the guilt of asking a coworker to cover a shift for you or the guilt of asking a manager if you could 
							take a day that you were assigned to come in and work off.</p>
